It is all about NetBeans plug-in development for NetBeans platform. This plug-in allows to create a new file type with extension .abc and provides multi tabs called design and source.

I planned to implement the plug-in from scratch, so after I implement some functionalities I will upload then it will be easy to follow things one by one.
